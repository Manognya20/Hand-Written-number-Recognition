# Hand-Written-number-Recognition
The Handwritten Digit Recognition System is a computer vision project that uses machine learning and deep learning techniques to accurately identify digits (0â€“9) written by hand. It simulates how a human can understand and interpret handwritten numbers, making it useful in areas such as postal services, banking, and automated data entry systems.
